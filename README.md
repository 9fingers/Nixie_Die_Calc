# Nixie_Die_Calc<br />
An Arduino 2560 controlled die calculator that uses a 5.0" TFT for inputs, and displays the results on eh screen, and Nixie tubes. 


TFT control sketch is using the stock Adafrtuit RA8875 library.<br />

Mentions:<br />
Nathaniel Burger: Software engineering manager.<br />
Assisted early on in the project by helping to explain the different building blocks while writing the code. Functions, variables (global and local), and plenty of other pointers that I failed to grasp at the time.

Cody Tappan: Embedded systems engineer. <br />
His code is commented in the project. Assisted with cursor tracking, and mapping the touch screen. 1024x1024 touch interface over a rectangular screen. 

Elliot Due: Electrical Engineer.<br />
Assisted with features that I decided to remove from the project as the scope of the project changed, and they were no longer needed. I learned a lot about board design, and reading electronics schematics. 

Eli Delia: Entrepreneur, graphics designer, jack of all trades.<br />
Modeled the dragon head for the final build. Introduced me to Fusion 360, and is defining the 3D print jobs for the final build. 

Last but not least, Conor Mooreman: Muse<br />
Conor was my inspiration to start this project, and to see it through to completion. So many times I have started projects like this and not completed them. Am truly happy to have this one so close to completion, can't wait for him to be able to try to use this. Conor has limited mobility, and dexterity, thus he cannot retrieve dice once they are rolled. He was using an app to roll dice which is just....well....boring. Hence the Nixie Die Calculator was born.</br>

On a side note this system can be used without the tubes, and only the touch screen display, and the SD card.
